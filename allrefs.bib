@article{Kungwan2012,
abstract = {The dynamics of the excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) in a cluster of 2-(2[prime or minute]-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HBT) and hydrogen-bonded water molecules was investigated by means of quantum chemical simulations. Two different enol ground-state structures of HBT interacting with the water cluster were chosen as initial structures for the excited-state dynamics: (i) an intramolecular hydrogen-bonded structure of HBT and (ii) a cluster where the intramolecular hydrogen bond in HBT is broken by intermolecular interactions with water molecules. On-the-fly dynamics simulations using time-dependent density functional theory show that after photoexcitation to the S1 state the ESPT pathway leading to the keto form strongly depends on the initial ground state structure of the HBT-water cluster. In the intramolecular hydrogen-bonded structures direct excited-state proton transfer is observed within 18 fs, which is a factor two faster than proton transfer in HBT computed for the gas phase. Intermolecular bonded HBT complexes show a complex pattern of excited-state proton transfer involving several distinct mechanisms. In the main process the tautomerization proceeds via a triple proton transfer through the water network with an average proton transfer time of approximately 120 fs. Due to the lack of the stabilizing hydrogen bond, intermolecular hydrogen-bonded structures have a significant degree of interring twisting already in the ground state. During the excited state dynamics, the twist tends to quickly increase indicating that internal conversion to the electronic ground state should take place at the sub-picosecond scale.},

abstract = {Ab initio second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations using the resolution of the identity (RI) method have been performed on poly-(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) oligomers with chain lengths up to eight phenyl rings. Vertical excitation energies for the four lowest $\pi$-$\pi$* excitations and geometry relaxation effects for the lowest excited state (S1) are reported. Extrapolation to infinite chain length shows good agreement with analogous data derived from experiment. Analysis of the bond length alternation (BLA) based on the optimized S1 geometry provides conclusive evidence for the localization of the defect in the center of the oligomer chain. Torsional potentials have been computed for the four excited states investigated and the transition densities divided into fragment contributions have been used to identify excitonic interactions. The present investigation provides benchmark results, which can be used (i) as reference for lower level methods and (ii) give the possibility to parametrize an effective Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian for quantum dynamical simulations of ultrafast exciton transfer dynamics in PPV type systems.},

@article{DNA_Topics,
abstract = {Absorption of UV light by nucleic acids can lead to damaging photoreactions, which may ultimately lead to mutations of the genetic code. The complexity of the photodynamical behavior of nucleobases in the DNA double-helix provides a great challenge to both experimental and computational chemists studying these processes. Starting from the initially excited states, the main question regards the understanding of the subsequent relaxation processes, which can either utilize monomer-like deactivation pathways or lead to excitonic or charge transfer species with new relaxation dynamics. After a review of photophysical processes in single nucleobases we outline the theoretical background relevant for interacting chromophores and assess a large variety of computational approaches relevant for the understanding of the nature and dynamics of excited states of DNA. The discussion continues with the analysis of calculations on excitonic and charge transfer states followed by the presentation of the dynamics of excited-state processes in DNA. The review is concluded by topics on proton transfer in DNA and photochemical dimer formation of nucleobases.},

@article{Cui2014,
abstract = {The $\pi$-bonded tetracyanoethylene anion dimer (TCNE2 (2-) ) and the neutral K2 TCNE2 system have been investigated to obtain new insights into the unique features of two-electron multicenter (2e-mc) $\pi$-pancake bonding. The inter-radical interaction leads to a significant diradicaloid character described by two singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) of the monomers. A highly correlated approach, the multireference averaged quadratic coupled-cluster (MR-AQCC) method, has been used to achieve a balanced description of the different types of electron correlation that occur in this system. The analysis of the interaction energies for the two systems in the singlet and the lowest triplet states and of the unpaired electron densities demonstrate the importance of diradical $\pi$ bonding in addition to the conventional van der Waals interactions that occur in intermolecular interactions. In this analysis, the separation of the repulsive Coulomb interaction energies from the remaining terms turned out to be a crucial prerequisite to achieve consistent results. Our calculations also confirm that the driving force behind the energetic stability of the pancake bonds predominantly derives from the overlap of the SOMO-SOMO bonding interaction.},

With time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), its value as well as the overall description of the exciton is almost exclusively governed by the amount of nonlocal orbital exchange.

abstract = {The COLUMBUS Program System allows high-level quantum chemical calculations based on the multiconfiguration self-consistent field, multireference configuration interaction with singles and doubles, and the multireference averaged quadratic coupled cluster methods. The latter method includes size-consistency corrections at the multireference level. Nonrelativistic (NR) and spin-orbit calculations are available within multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). A prominent feature of COLUMBUS is the availability of analytic energy gradients and nonadiabatic coupling vectors for NR MRCI. This feature allows efficient optimization of stationary points and surface crossings (minima on the crossing seam). Typical applications are systematic surveys of energy surfaces in ground and excited states including bond breaking. Wave functions of practically any sophistication can be constructed limited primarily by the size of the CI expansion rather than by its complexity. A massively parallel CI step allows state-of-the art calculations with up to several billion configurations. Electrostatic embedding of point charges into the molecular Hamiltonian gives access to quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics calculations for all wave functions available in COLUMBUS. The analytic gradient modules allow on-the-fly nonadiabatic photodynamical simulations of interesting chemical and biological problems. Thus, COLUMBUS provides a wide range of highly sophisticated tools with which a large variety of interesting quantum chemical problems can be studied. (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

Transitions have been assigned, and the form of the excitations has been analyzed. The majority of the excitations could be classified as localized on the nucleobases, but for all three studied systems, charge-transfer (CT) transitions could also be identified. The main aim of this study was to compare the performance of lower-level methods (ADC(2) and TDDFT) to the high-level EOM-CC ones. It was shown that both ADC(2) and TDDFT with long-range correction have nonsystematic error in excitation energies, causing alternation of the energetic ordering of the excitations. Considering the high costs of the EOM-CC calculations, there is a need for reliable new approximate methods.},

abstract = {A new internally contracted direct multiconfiguration-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) method is described which allows the use of much larger reference spaces than any previous MRCI method. The configurations with two electrons in the external orbital space are generated by applying pair excitation operators to the reference wave function as a whole, while the singly external and internal configurations are standard un contracted spin eigenfunctions. A new efficient and simple method for the calculation of the coupling coefficients is used, which is well suited for vector machines, and allows the recalculation of all coupling coefficients each time they are needed. The vector H·c is computed partly in a nonorthogonal configuration basis. In order to test the accuracy of the internally contracted wave functions, benchmark calculations have been performed for F-, H2 0, NHz, CH2, CH3, OH, NO, N2, and 0z at various geometries. The deviations of the energies obtained with internally contracted and un contracted MRCI wave functions are mostly smaller than 1 mH and typically 3-5 times smaller than the deviations between the uncontracted MRCI and the full CI. Dipole moments, electric dipole polarizabilities, and electronic dipole transition moments calculated with un contracted and contracted MRCI wave functions also are found to be in close agreement. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in large scale calculations for the CN, NH3, CO2 , and Cr2 molecules. In these calculations up to 3088 reference configurations and up to 154 orbitals were employed. The biggest calculation is equivalent to an uncontracted MRCI with more than 78 million configurations.},

Formal relationships and numerical techniques for the typical configuration interaction (CI) approaches, up to full CI, are given and illustrated with simple molecular systems. Comparison of the molecular orbital and full CI results indicates strong electron correlation effects, especially for the 3-center and 4-center bond indices. Excited state multicenter bond indices are described within the CI singles approach.

Detailed computations and spectral (natural orbital) treatment of the CIS density matrices of various types are presented. The corresponding hole-particle densities and related excitation localization indices are described. All the quantities are extended to the excited states calculated in the random phase approximation and closely related time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The localization indices and charge transfer numbers which are invoked to describe interfragment interactions provide a basis for Our scheme which is referred to as the excited state structural analysis for electronic transitions. The proposed analysis is exemplified by various moderate and large-size conjugated molecules treated within ab initio TDDFT and the Parizer-Parr-Pople approximation. Finally, we propose a possible generalization to the electronic transitions between CIS-like states followed by applications to singlet organic biradicals treated within the pi-electron spin-flip CIS.

The dependence of exciton splitting upon orientation and intermonomer distance was explored. Splittings of triplet states are seen to be nontrivial at typical bonding distances, commensurate with the splittings of weakly allowed singlet states. Charge-transfer interaction with the excimer states is seen to be most significant in face-to-face orientations which can allow closer approach of the two monomers. Predictions of the prominent features of the singlet-singlet and triplet-triplet absorption spectra agree well with experimental findings. A spin-orbit channel-counting scheme is introduced to account for observed radiative and nonradiative decay of the T-1 triplet state of the monomer, and then applied to the dimer. The mechanism has been found for the observed more rapid phosphorescence of the T-1 state of the dimer when placed in orientations lacking inversion symmetry. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Within this method, the excitation energies and transition densities of the system are used to derive the coupling matrix element. The scheme allows one to treat systems where exciton donor and acceptor are close together and their exchange interaction and orbital overlap are significant. The FTD method can be applied in combination with any quantum mechanical approach to treat excited states of general nature including single-, double-, and higher excitations. Using FTD approach, we derive excitonic couplings for several systems computed with the CIS, TD DFT and MS-CASPT2 methods. In particular, it is shown that the estimated coupling values in DNA $\pi$-stacks are strongly affected by the short-range electronic interaction of adjacent nucleobases.},

@article{Kuik2014,
abstract = {This article reviews the basic physical processes of charge transport and recombination in organic semiconductors. As a workhorse, LEDs based on a single layer of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivatives are used. The hole transport in these PPV derivatives is governed by trap-free space-charge-limited conduction, with the mobility depending on the electric field and charge-carrier density. These dependencies are generally described in the framework of hopping transport in a Gaussian density of states distribution. The electron transport on the other hand is orders of magnitude lower than the hole transport. The reason is that electron transport is hindered by the presence of a universal electron trap, located at 3.6 eV below vacuum with a typical density of ca. 3 × 10¹⁷ cm⁻³. The trapped electrons recombine with free holes via a non-radiative trap-assisted recombination process, which is a competing loss process with respect to the emissive bimolecular Langevin recombination. The trap-assisted recombination in disordered organic semiconductors is governed by the diffusion of the free carrier (hole) towards the trapped carrier (electron), similar to the Langevin recombination of free carriers where both carriers are mobile. As a result, with the charge-carrier mobilities and amount of trapping centers known from charge-transport measurements, the radiative recombination as well as loss processes in disordered organic semiconductors can be fully predicted. Evidently, future work should focus on the identification and removing of electron traps. This will not only eliminate the non-radiative trap-assisted recombination, but, in addition, will shift the recombination zone towards the center of the device, leading to an efficiency improvement of more than a factor of two in single-layer polymer LEDs.},

In the first part, conceptual strategies for the correct determination of optical transitions from experimental spectra and relevant extrapolation procedures at the polymer limit are introduced. The impact of conformational, substitution, solvent, and solid-state effects on the optical properties is discussed in light of experimental data reported for molecular backbones based on phenylene, phenylenevinylene, and thiophene repeat units. A comparison is then made between experimental results and those provided by standard quantum-chemical methods, to assess their reliability.},

abstract = {Nanoscale systems are forecast to be a means of integrating desirable attributes of molecular and bulk regimes into easily processed materials. Notable examples include plastic light-emitting devices and organic solar cells, the operation of which hinge on the formation of electronic excited states, excitons, in complex nanostructured materials. The spectroscopy of nanoscale materials reveals details of their collective excited states, characterized by atoms or molecules working together to capture and redistribute excitation. What is special about excitons in nanometre-sized materials? Here we present a cross-disciplinary review of the essential characteristics of excitons in nanoscience. Topics covered include confinement effects, localization versus delocalization, exciton binding energy, exchange interactions and exciton fine structure, exciton-vibration coupling and dynamics of excitons. Important examples are presented in a commentary that overviews the present understanding of excitons in quantum dots, conjugated polymers, carbon nanotubes and photosynthetic light-harvesting antenna complexes.},

abstract = {We investigate the role of excess excitation energy on the nature of photoexcitations in donor-acceptor $\pi$-conjugated materials. We compare the polymer poly(2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b;3,4-b']dithiophene)-4,7-benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole) (PCPDTBT) and a short oligomer with identical constituents at different excitation wavelengths, from the near-infrared up to the ultraviolet spectral region. Ultrafast spectroscopic measurements clearly show an increased polaron pair yield for higher excess energies directly after photoexcitation when compared to the exciton population. This effect, already observable in the polymer, is even more pronounced for the shorter oligomer. Supported by quantum chemical simulations, we show that excitation in high-energy states generates electron and hole wave functions with reduced overlap, which likely act as precursors for the polaron pairs. Interestingly, in the oligomer we observe a lifetime of polaron pairs which is one order of magnitude longer. We suggest that this behavior results from the intermolecular nature of polaron pairs in oligomers. The study excludes the presence of carrier multiplication in these materials and highlights new aspects in the photophysics of donor-acceptor small molecules when compared to polymers. The former are identified as promising materials for efficient organic photovoltaics.},

@article{Savoie2013,
abstract = {We present results showing that common approximations employed in the design and characterization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials can lead to significant errors in widely adopted design rules. First, we assess the validity of the common practice of using HOMO and LUMO energies in place of formal redox potentials to characterize organic semiconductors. We trace the formal justification for this practice and survey its limits in a way that should be useful for those entering the field. We find that while the HOMO and LUMO energies represent useful descriptive approximations, they are too quantitatively inaccurate for predictive material design. Second, we show that the excitonic nature of common organic semiconductors makes it paramount to distinguish between the optical and electronic bandgaps for materials design. Our analysis shows that the usefulness of the "LUMO-LUMO Offset" as a design parameter for exciton dissociation is directly tied to the accuracy of the one-electron approximation. In particular, our results suggest that the use of the "LUMO-LUMO Offset" as a measure of the driving force for exciton dissociation leads to a systematic overestimation that should be cautiously avoided.},

abstract = {Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) offer the opportunity for cheap, lightweight and mass-producible devices. However, an incomplete understanding of the charge generation process, in particular the timescale of dynamics and role of exciton diffusion, has slowed further progress in the field. We report a new Kinetic Monte Carlo model for the exciton dissociation mechanism in OPVs that addresses the origin of ultra-fast (<1 ps) dissociation by incorporating exciton delocalization. The model reproduces experimental results, such as the diminished rapid dissociation with increasing domain size, and also lends insight into the interplay between mixed domains, domain geometry, and exciton delocalization. Additionally, the model addresses the recent dispute on the origin of ultra-fast exciton dissociation by comparing the effects of exciton delocalization and impure domains on the photo-dynamics.This model provides insight into exciton dynamics that can advance our understanding of OPV structure-function relationships.},

abstract = {The excitonic spectra of a number of conjugated polymers, polythiophene (PT), polyphenylenevinylene (PPV), ladder-type poly-para-phenylene (LPPP), trans-polyacetylene (PA), and polydiacetylene (PDA), are calculated by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation for the two-body Green function of the electron–hole pair. The only input to the calculation is the bulk dielectric constant. We find intermediate binding energies of 0.4–0.6 eV for the lowest optical 1 1 B u exciton, obtaining good agreement with recent experiments for each polymer individually. The agreement for the singlet–triplet splittings and the 1 1 B u polarizabilities is satisfactory. This also holds for the 1 1 B u –2 1 A g splittings in PT, LPPP, and PPV. For PA and PDA we find the 2 1 A g exciton above the 1 1 B u exciton, in contrast with experiment; a possible explanation for this discrepancy is the absence of lattice relaxation effects and double excitations in our calculations.},

@article{Beenken2009,
abstract = {We have previously shown that both, polymer conformation and dynamics are crucial for the exciton transport in conjugated polymers. Thereby we found that the usual Forster-type hopping transfer model - even if one applies the line-dipole approximation - falls short in one crucial aspect: the nature of the sites the excitons are transferred between is still unclear. We found that the simple model of spectroscopic units defined as segments of the polymer chains separated by structural defects breaking the pi-conjugation is only justified for chemical defects like hydrogenated double bonds, or extreme gauche (90 degrees) torsions between the monomers. Both defects are far too rare in a well-prepared conjugated polymer to explain the mean spectroscopic-unit length of typically 6-7 monomers. Meanwhile, also the concept of dynamical formation of the spectroscopic units, we had previously suggested, has also failed. Thus the question of a paradigma change concerning the exciton transport in conjugated polymers appears on the agenda. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

The presence of conformational kinks yields a multichromophoric picture for the electronic excitations, where conjugated segments with an average length of approximately 8 repeat units are delineated by defects. This description applies to both isolated chains and to the bulk material, though very different dynamics are at play. Calculations on interacting polymer chains show that local fluctuations in the density give rise to chains that are on average more planar and thus appear as red sites. These results are discussed in light of recent single molecule spectroscopy data.},

abstract = {Exciton dynamics governs energy transfer and charge generation in organic functional materials. We investigate high-energy nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics for a bithiophene dimer to describe time-dependent excitonic effects in molecular aggregates. We show that the lowest excited states are populated on the subpicosecond time scale. These states are localized and unproductive in terms of charge separation. Productive high-energy charge-transfer (CT) states are populated within 50 fs during exciton deactivation, but they are short-lived (∼100 fs) and quickly transfer their population to lower states. Our simulations offer molecular-level insights into ultrafast photoinduced charge separation potentially triggered by hot CT states in solid-state organic materials. Design rules are suggested to increase hot exciton lifetimes, favoring the population of CT states as gateways for direct charge generation. These rules may boost the CT quantum yield by depleting unproductive recombination channels.},

abstract = {We investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, a series of novel molecules consisting of conjugated segments (such as stilbene, naphthylene, and anthrylene) that are separated from each other by nonconjugated bridges. Excited state localization effects are studied theoretically by post-Hartree-Fock calculations-taking into account electron correlation effects. In this context, we compute the electron-hole two-particle wave functions for the prominent excited states and discuss the nature of the molecular orbitals involved in their description. We also investigate geometry relaxation effects following the electronic excitations in order to locate the regions where the strongest rearrangement of the electron density occurs. These conceptionally different approaches (relying also on different semiempirical Hamilton operators and configuration interaction techniques) yield consistent results regarding the localization of the excitations and thus prove helpful to determine the nature of the lowest excited states in such multichromophoric systems. Knowing the exact nature of the different states observed in the experimental absorption and luminescence excitation spectra allows for selective excitations of the different segments of the molecules. When performing site- selective spectroscopy, we find that in all the materials the emission originates from the S-1-->S-0 transition, independent of the excitation wavelengths. This points to an efficient intramolecular energy transfer that occurs in spite of the broken conjugation between the molecular building blocks. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

In recent years, the second-order ADC(2) schemehas attracted attention in the computational chemistry community because of its reliable accuracy and reasonable computational effort in the calculation of predominantly singly excited states.Owingto their size-consistency,ADCmethods are suited for the investigation of large molecules. In addition, their Hermitian structure and the availability of the intermediate state representation (ISR) allow for straightforward computation of excited-state properties. Recently, an efficient implementation of ADC(3) has been reported, and its high accuracy for typical valence excited states of organic chromophores has been demonstrated. In this review, the origin of ADC-based excited-state methods in propagator theory is described, and an intuitive route for the derivation of algebraic expressions via the ISR is outlined and comparison to other excited-state methods is made. Existing computer codes and implemented ADC variants are reviewed, but most importantly the accuracy and limits of different ADC schemes are critically examined.},

The accuracies of ADC(2) and ADC(3) schemes have been investigated with respect to Thiel's recently established benchmark set for excitation energies and oscillator strengths. The calculation of 141 vertical excited singlet and 71 triplet states of 28 small to medium-sized organic molecules has revealed that ADC(3) exhibits mean error and standard deviation of 0.12 ± 0.28 eV for singlet states and -0.18 ± 0.16 eV for triplet states when the provided theoretical best estimates are used as benchmark. Accordingly, the ADC(2)-s and ADC(2)-x calculations revealed accuracies of 0.22 ± 0.38 eV and -0.70 ± 0.37 eV for singlets and 0.12 ± 0.16 eV and -0.55 ± 0.20 eV for triplets, respectively. For a comparison of CC3 and ADC(3), only non-CC3 benchmark values were considered, which comprise 84 singlet states and 19 triplet states. For these singlet states CC3 exhibits an accuracy of 0.23 ± 0.21 eV and ADC(3) an accuracy of 0.08 ± 0.27 eV, and accordingly for the triplet states of 0.12 ± 0.10 eV and -0.10 ± 0.13 eV, respectively. Hence, based on the quality of the existing benchmark set it is practically not possible to judge whether ADC(3) or CC3 is more accurate, however, ADC(3) has a much larger range of applicability due to its more favourable scaling of O(N(6)) with system size.},

abstract = {The derivation of response functions for coupled cluster models is discussed in a context where approximations can be introduced in the coupled cluster equations. The linear response function is derived for the approximate coupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples model CC3. The linear response functions for the approximate triples models, CCSDT‐1a and CCSDT‐1b, are obtained as simplifications to the CC3 linear response function. The consequences of these simplifications are discussed for the evaluation of molecular properties, in particular, for excitation energies. Excitation energies obtained from the linear response eigenvalue equation are analyzed in orders of the fluctuation potential. Double replacement dominated excitations are correct through second order in all the triples models mentioned, whereas they are only correct to first order in the coupled cluster singles and doubles model (CCSD). Single replacement dominated excitation energies are correct through third order in CC3, while in CCSDT‐1a, CCSDT‐1b, and CCSD they are only correct through second order. Calculations of excitation energies are reported for CH+, N2, and C2H4 to illustrate the accuracy that can be obtained in the various triples models. The CH+ results are compared to full configuration interaction results, the C2H4 results are compared with complete active space second order perturbation theory (CASPT2) and experiment, and the N2 results are compared to experiment. Double replacement dominated excitations are improved significantly relative to CCSD in all the triples models mentioned, and is of the same quality in CC3 and CCSDT‐1a. The single replacement dominated excitation are close to full configuration interaction results for the CC3 model and significantly improved relative to CCSD. The CCSDT‐1 results for the single replacement dominated excitations are not improved compared to CCSD. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The performance of the second-order methods for excitation energies CC2 and ADC(2) is investigated and compared with the more approximate CIS and CIS(D) methods as well as with the coupled-cluster models CCSD, CCSDR(3) and CC3. As a by-product of this investigation the first implementation of analytic excited state gradients for ADC(2) and CIS(D,,) is reported. It is found that for equilibrium structures and vibrational frequencies the second-order models CIS(D), ADC(2) and CC2 give often results close to those obtained with CCSD. The main advantage of CCSD lies in its robustness with respect to strong correlation effects. For adiabatic excitation energies CC2 is found to give from all second-order methods for excitation energies (including CCSD) the smallest mean absolute errors. ADC(2) and CIS(D 0) are found to give almost identical results. An advantage of ADC(2) compared to CC2 is that the excitation energies are obtained as eigenvalues of a Hermitian secular matrix, while in coupled-cluster response the excitation energies are obtained as eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian Jacobi matrix. It is shown that, as a consequence of the lack of Hermitian symmetry, the latter methods will in general not give a physically correct description of conical intersections between states of the same symmetry. This problem does not appear in ADC(2).},

abstract = {The utility of the norms of one-particle density matrices, ∥$\gamma$∥, for understanding the trends in electronic properties is discussed. Using several model systems that are relevant in the context of singlet fission (butadiene, octatetraene, and ethylene dimer), the dependence of interstate properties (such as transition dipole moments and nonadiabatic couplings, NACs) on molecular geometries is investigated. ∥$\gamma$∥ contains the principal information about the changes in electronic states involved, such as varying degree of one-electron character of the transition; thus, it captures leading trends in one-electron interstate properties (i.e., when ∥$\gamma$∥ is small, the respective interstate matrix elements are also small). However, finer variations in properties that arise due to the dependence of the matrix elements of the respective operators may not be reproduced. Analysis of NACs in ethylene dimer reveals that intermolecular components of NACs follow the trends in ∥$\gamma$∥ well, as they are determined primarily by the characters of the two wave functions; however, intramolecular components depend on the relative orientation of the two moieties via the dependence in the derivative of the electron-nuclear Coulomb operator. Therefore, intramolecular NACs may exhibit large variations even when the changes in ∥$\gamma$∥ are small. We observe large NACs at perfectly stacked geometry; however, larger values (by a factor of 1.6) are observed at slip-stacked (along the long axis) geometries. Larger values of NACs at slip-stacked configurations are due to the breaking of symmetry of the local environment of the heavy atoms and not due to the wave function composition. We found that the variations in ∥$\gamma$∥ for ethylene dimer are due to a varying admixture of the charge-resonance configurations in the S1 state, whereas the (1)ME state retains its pure multiexciton character.},

The first two \$A\_\{1\}\$ singlet states of the CH cation are used as an initial example.

For each method we compare the important natural transition geminals with the dominant natural transition orbitals. We then compare SA-MCCI and full configuration interaction (FCI) with regards to the natural transition geminals using the beryllium atom. We compare using the natural transition geminals with analyzing the important configurations in the CI expansion to give the dominant transition for the beryllium atom and the carbon dimer. Finally we calculate the natural transition geminals for two electronic excitations of formamide.},

abstract = {Many-body processes inevitably lead to the transition from one many-body wavefunction to another. Due to the complexity of the initial and final states many-body wavefunctions, one often wishes to try and describe such transitions using only a single-particle function. While there are numerous types of orbitals and densities which are commonly used, the question remains which one is optimal and in which sense. Here we present the optimal one and two body functions whose anti-symmetrized product with the initial state yields the maximal overlap with the final state. A definition of the above optimal condition and its rigorous proof are given. The resulting optimal functions shed additional light on the well-known Dyson orbital and reduced transition matrix, demonstrating further their physical meaning as independent functions.},

@article{Pelzer2011,
abstract = {Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of organic molecules with importance in several branches of science, including medicine, combustion chemistry, and materials science. The delocalized $\pi$-orbital systems in PAHs require highly accurate electronic structure methods to capture strong electron correlation. Treating correlation in PAHs has been challenging because (i) traditional wave function methods for strong correlation have not been applicable since they scale exponentially in the number of strongly correlated orbitals, and (ii) alternative methods such as the density-matrix renormalization group and variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) methods have not been applied beyond linear acene chains. In this paper we extend the earlier results from active-space variational 2-RDM theory [Gidofalvi, G.; Mazziotti, D. A. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 129, 134108] to the more general two-dimensional arrangement of rings--acene sheets--to study the relationship between geometry and electron correlation in PAHs. The acene-sheet calculations, if performed with conventional wave function methods, would require wave function expansions with as many as 1.5 × 10(17) configuration state functions. To measure electron correlation, we employ several RDM-based metrics: (i) natural-orbital occupation numbers, (ii) the 1-RDM von Neumann entropy, (iii) the correlation energy per carbon atom, and (iv) the squared Frobenius norm of the cumulant 2-RDM. The results confirm a trend of increasing polyradical character with increasing molecular size previously observed in linear PAHs and reveal a corresponding trend in two-dimensional (arch-shaped) PAHs. Furthermore, in PAHs of similar size they show significant variations in correlation with geometry. PAHs with the strictly linear geometry (chains) exhibit more electron correlation than PAHs with nonlinear geometries (sheets).},

abstract = {Absorption of UV radiation by DNA bases is known to induce carcinogenic mutations. The lesion distribution depends on the sequence around the hotspots, suggesting cooperativity between bases. Here we show that such cooperativity may intervene at the very first step of a cascade of events by formation of Franck-Condon states delocalized over several bases and subsequent energy transfer faster than 100 fs. Our study focuses on the double helix poly(dA).poly(dT), whose fluorescence, induced by femtosecond pulses at 267 nm, is probed by the upconversion technique and time-correlated single photon counting, over a large time domain (100 fs to 100 ns). The time-resolved fluorescence decays and fluorescence anisotropy decays are discussed in relation with the steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra in the frame of exciton theory.},

abstract = {A new formulation of the spin-flip (SF) method is presented. The electronic wave function is specified by the definition of an active space and through alpha-to-beta excitations from a Hartree-Fock reference. The method belongs to the restricted active space (RAS) family, where the CI expansion is restricted by classifying the molecular orbitals in three subspaces. Properties such as spin completeness, variationality, size consistency, size intensivity, and orbital invariance are discussed. The implementation and applications use a particular truncation of the wave function, with the inclusion of hole and particle contributions such that for fixed active space size, the number of amplitudes is linear in molecular size. This approach is used to investigate single and double bond-breaking, the singlet-triplet gap of linear acenes, electronic transitions in three Ni(II) octahedral complexes, the low-lying states of the 2,5-didehydrometaxylylene (DDMX) tetraradical and the ground state multiplicity of 28 non-Kekul\'{e} structures. The results suggest that this approach can provide a quite well balanced description of nearly degenerate electronic states at moderate computational cost.},

@article{Krauter2014,
abstract = {In solid state physics, electronic excitations are often classified as plasmons or single-particle excitations. The former class of states refers to collective oscillations of the electron density. The random-phase approximation allows for a quantum-theoretical treatment and a characterization on a microscopic level as a coherent superposition of a large number of particle-hole transitions with the same momentum transfer. However, small systems such as molecules or small nanoclusters lack the basic properties (momentum conservation and uniform exchange interaction) responsible for the formation of plasmons in the solid-state case. Despite an enhanced interest in plasmon-based technologies and an increasing number of studies regarding plasmons in molecules and small nanoclusters, their definition on a microscopic level of theory remains ambiguous. In this work, we analyze the microscopic properties of molecular plasmons in comparison with the homogeneous electron gas as a model system. Subsequently, the applicability of the derived characteristics is validated by analyzing the electronic excitation vectors with respect to orbital transitions for two linear polyenes within second order versions of the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the polarization propagator.},

abstract = {The classification of electronic excitations in molecules and molecular nanostructures plays an important role when tailoring materials with desired properties. One example of such a class of excitations are plasmons. Plasmons appear in solid-state physics, where they are characterized as density oscillations in an electron gas that are driven by the restoring forces associated with the electromagnetic field induced by the density oscillations themselves. Here, we investigate how this concept can be transferred to molecular systems by performing a step-by-step analysis, starting from three-dimensional bulk systems and ending with molecules. On the basis of this analysis, we propose to scale the electron?electron interaction in quantum-chemical response calculations in order to identify plasmons in molecules. This approach is illustrated for molecular chains and clusters. Our results show that the concept of plasmons is still applicable for extended molecular systems and demonstrate that the proposed scaling approach provides an easy way of characterizing electronic excitations.},

@article{Mulliken1955,
abstract = {With increasing availability of good all‐electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total ``gross atomic populations,'' or into partial and total ``net atomic populations'' together with ``overlap populations.'' ``Gross atomic populations'' distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded.Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self‐consistent field) LCAO‐MO data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s‐p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the $\pi$ bonds in CO, the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ overlap populations are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total overlap population for the $\pi$ electrons is about twice that for the $\sigma$ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94\% localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.},

Usually, density functional theory is the method of choice for theoretical studies on transition metal complexes and clusters mostly because it is the only feasible one, although its results are not systematically improvable. By contrast, multireference ab initio methods could provide a correct description of the electronic structure, but are limited to small molecules because of the tremendous computational resources required. In recent years, conceptually new ab initio methods emerged that turned out to be promising for theoretical coordination chemistry. We review and discuss two efficient parametrization schemes for the electronic wave function, the matrix product states and the complete-graph tensor network states. Their advantages are demonstrated at example transition metal complexes. Especially, tensor network states might provide the key to accurately describe strongly correlated and magnetic molecular systems in transition metal chemistry.},

In the present paper, a simple dimer model is used to show that, in general, the dipole moment is not a valid measure of the CT contribution. This finding eliminates some apparent disagreement between the computational results published by different research groups. The implications of our results and other related aspects of cluster-type quantum chemistry calculations are discussed in the context of the standing literature dispute concerning the mechanism of singlet fission in the pentacene crystal, notably the role of charge transfer contributions vs the involvement of an excimer-like doubly excited intermediate (D state).},

abstract = {Multi-exciton generation-the creation of multiple charge carrier pairs from a single photon-has been reported for several materials and may dramatically increase solar cell efficiency. Singlet fission, its molecular analogue, may govern multi-exciton generation in a variety of materials, but a fundamental mechanism for singlet fission has yet to be described. Here, we use sophisticated ab initio calculations to show that singlet fission in pentacene proceeds through rapid internal conversion of the photoexcited state into a dark state of multi-exciton character that efficiently splits into two triplets. We show that singlet fission to produce a pair of triplet excitons must involve an intermediate state that (i) has a multi-exciton character, (ii) is energetically accessible from the optically allowed excited state, and (iii) efficiently dissociates into multiple electron-hole pairs. The rational design of photovoltaic materials that make use of singlet fission will require similar ab initio analysis of multi-exciton states such as the dark state studied here.},

abstract = {Singlet fission (SF) could dramatically increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by producing two triplet excitons from each absorbed photon. While this process has been known for decades, most descriptions have assumed the necessity of a charge-transfer intermediate. This ab initio study characterizes the low-lying excited states in acene molecular crystals in order to describe how SF occurs in a realistic crystal environment. Intermolecular interactions are shown to localize the initially delocalized bright state onto a pair of monomers. From this localized state, nonadiabatic coupling mediated by intermolecular motion between the optically allowed exciton and a dark multi-exciton state facilitates SF without the need for a nearby low-lying charge-transfer intermediate. An estimate of the crossing rate shows that this direct quantum mechanical process occurs in well under 1 ps in pentacene. In tetracene, the dark multi-exciton state is uphill from the lowest singlet excited state, resulting in a dynamic interplay between SF and triplet-triplet annihilation.},

However, the dynamical mechanism of this phenomenon is not fully understood and a complete, microscopic theory of singlet fission is lacking. In this work, we assemble the components of a comprehensive microscopic theory of singlet fission that connects excited state quantum chemistry calculations with finite-temperature quantum relaxation theory. We elaborate on the distinction between localized diabatic and delocalized exciton bases for the interpretation of singlet fission experiments in both the time and frequency domains. We discuss various approximations to the exact density matrix dynamics and propose Redfield theory as an ideal compromise between speed and accuracy for the detailed investigation of singlet fission in dimers, clusters, and crystals. Investigations of small model systems based on parameters typical of singlet fission demonstrate the numerical accuracy and practical utility of this approach.},

abstract = {Excited states of the double-stranded DNA model (A)(12)center dot(T)(12) were calculated in the framework of the Frenkel exciton theory. The off-diagonal elements of the exciton matrix were calculated using the transition densities and ideal dipole approximation associated with the lowest energy pi pi(*) excitations of the individual nucleobases as obtained from time-dependent density functional theory calculations. The values of the coupling calculated with the transition density cubes (TDC) and ideal dipole approximation (IDA) methods were found to be significantly different for the small interchromophore distances. It was shown that the IDA overestimates the coupling significantly. The effects of structural fluctuations of the DNA chain on the magnitude of dipolar coupling were also found to be very significant. The difference between the maximum and minimum values was as large as 1000 and 300 cm(-1) for the IDA and TDC methods, respectively. To account for these effects, the properties of the excited states were averaged over a large number of conformations obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations. Our calculations using the TDC method indicate that the absorption of the UV light creates exciton states carrying the majority of the oscillator strength that are delocalized over at least six DNA bases. Upon relaxation, the excitation states localize over at least four contiguous bases. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The synthesis and photophysical study of a family of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes are reported. The iridium complexes have two cyclometalated (C(**)N) ligands and a single monoanionic, bidentate ancillary ligand (LX), i.e., C(**)N2Ir(LX). The C(**)N ligands can be any of a wide variety of organometallic ligands. The LX ligands used for this study were all beta-diketonates, with the major emphasis placed on acetylacetonate (acac) complexes. The majority of the C(**)N2Ir(acac) complexes phosphoresce with high quantum efficiencies (solution quantum yields, 0.1-0.6), and microsecond lifetimes (e.g., 1-14 micros). The strongly allowed phosphorescence in these complexes is the result of significant spin-orbit coupling of the Ir center. The lowest energy (emissive) excited state in these C(**)N2Ir(acac) complexes is a mixture of (3)MLCT and (3)(pi-pi) states. By choosing the appropriate C(**)N ligand, C(**)N2Ir(acac) complexes can be prepared which emit in any color from green to red. Simple, systematic changes in the C(**)N ligands, which lead to bathochromic shifts of the free ligands, lead to similar bathochromic shifts in the Ir complexes of the same ligands, consistent with "C(**)N2Ir"-centered emission. Three of the C(**)N2Ir(acac) complexes were used as dopants for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The three Ir complexes, i.e., bis(2-phenylpyridinato-N,C2')iridium(acetylacetonate) [ppy2Ir(acac)], bis(2-phenyl benzothiozolato-N,C2')iridium(acetylacetonate) [bt2Ir(acac)], and bis(2-(2'-benzothienyl)pyridinato-N,C3')iridium(acetylacetonate) [btp2Ir(acac)], were doped into the emissive region of multilayer, vapor-deposited OLEDs. The ppy2Ir(acac)-, bt2Ir(acac)-, and btp2Ir(acac)-based OLEDs give green, yellow, and red electroluminescence, respectively, with very similar current-voltage characteristics. The OLEDs give high external quantum efficiencies, ranging from 6 to 12.3\%, with the ppy2Ir(acac) giving the highest efficiency (12.3\%, 38 lm/W, >50 Cd/A). The btp2Ir(acac)-based device gives saturated red emission with a quantum efficiency of 6.5\% and a luminance efficiency of 2.2 lm/W. These C(**)N2Ir(acac)-doped OLEDs show some of the highest efficiencies reported for organic light emitting diodes. The high efficiencies result from efficient trapping and radiative relaxation of the singlet and triplet excitons formed in the electroluminescent process.},

abstract = {Complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) wavefunctions and an orbital entanglement analysis obtained from a density-matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) calculation are used to understand the electronic structure, and in particular, the Ru–NO bond of a Ru nitrosyl complex. On the basis of configurations and orbital occupation numbers obtained for the CASSCF wavefunction and of the orbital entropy measurements evaluated for the DMRG wavefunction, we unravel electron-correlation effects in the Ru coordination sphere of the complex. It is shown that Ru–NO pi bonds show static and dynamic correlation, while other Ru–ligand bonds feature predominantly dynamic correlation. The presence of static correlation requires the use of multiconfigurational methods to describe the Ru–NO bond. Subsequently, the CASSCF wavefunction is analysed in terms of configuration state functions based on localised orbitals. The analysis of the wavefunctions in the electronic singlet ground state and the first triplet state provides a picture of the Ru–NO moiety beyond the standard representation based on formal oxidation states. A distinct description of the Ru and NO fragments is advocated. The electron configuration of Ru is an equally weighted superposition of RuII and RuIII configurations, with the RuIII configuration originating from charge donation mostly from Cl ligands. However, and contrary to what is typically assumed, the electronic configuration of the NO ligand is best described as electroneutral.},

abstract = "The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) provides a technically and economically credible alternative concept to present day p–n junction photovoltaic devices. In contrast to the conventional systems where the semiconductor assume both the task of light absorption and charge carrier transport the two functions are separated here. Light is absorbed by a sensitizer, which is anchored to the surface of a wide band semiconductor. Charge separation takes place at the interface via photo-induced electron injection from the dye into the conduction band of the solid. Carriers are transported in the conduction band of the semiconductor to the charge collector. The use of sensitizers having a broad absorption band in conjunction with oxide films of nanocrstalline morphology permits to harvest a large fraction of sunlight. Nearly quantitative conversion of incident photon into electric current is achieved over a large spectral range extending from the \{UV\} to the near \{IR\} region. Overall solar (standard \{AM\} 1.5) to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) over 10% have been reached. There are good prospects to produce these cells at lower cost than conventional devices. Here we present the current state of the field, discuss new concepts of the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cell (DSC) including heterojunction variants and analyze the perspectives for the future development of the technology.

The Dirac electrons can be controlled by application of external electric and magnetic fields, or by altering sample geometry and/or topology. The Dirac electrons behave in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and the integer quantum Hall effect. The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons. Different types of disorder modify the Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic and transport properties. The effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in single layer and multilayer graphene are also presented.},

@article{Middleton2009,
abstract = {Ultraviolet light is strongly absorbed by DNA, producing excited electronic states that sometimes initiate damaging photochemical reactions. Fully mapping the reactive and nonreactive decay pathways available to excited electronic states in DNA is a decades-old quest. Progress toward this goal has accelerated rapidly in recent years, in large measure because of ultrafast laser experiments. Here we review recent discoveries and controversies concerning the nature and dynamics of excited states in DNA model systems in solution. Nonradiative decay by single, solvated nucleotides occurs primarily on the subpicosecond timescale. Surprisingly, excess electronic energy relaxes one or two orders of magnitude more slowly in DNA oligo- and polynucleotides. Highly efficient nonradiative decay pathways guarantee that most excited states do not lead to deleterious reactions but instead relax back to the electronic ground state. Understanding how the spatial organization of the bases controls the relaxation of excess electronic energy in the double helix and in alternative structures is currently one of the most exciting challenges in the field.},

abstract = {Electron attachment to the trimer of nucleotide, dGpdCpdG, has been investigated by a quantum mechanical approach at a reliable level of theory. The study of the electron attached dGpdCpdG species demonstrates that cytosine contained DNA single strands have a strong tendency to capture low-energy electrons and to form electronically stable cytosine-centered radical anions. The comparative study of the model molecules pdCpdG and dGpdCp reveals that base stacking has little contribution to the adiabatic electron affinity (AEA) of cytosine in DNA single strands. Additionally, the base-base stacking does not affect the vertical detachment energy (VDE) of the cytosine-centered radicals. Intrastrand H-bonding is found to be critical in increasing the values of the AEA and VDE. However, base-base stacking is revealed to be important in enlarging the vertical electron affinity (VEA) of cytosine. The electron attachment to the cytosine moiety intensifies the intrastrand H-bonding between the neighboring G and C bases. This process disrupts the base-base stacking interaction in the radical anion of dGpdCpdG.},

abstract = {We present a systematic density functional theory study of the electronic properties, optical spectra, and relative thermodynamic stability of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons. We consider ribbons with different edge nature including bare and hydrogen-terminated ribbons, several crystallographic orientations, and widths up to 3 nm. Our results can be extrapolated to wider ribbons providing a qualitative way of determining the electronic properties of ribbons with widths of practical significance. We predict that in order to produce materials with band gaps similar to Ge or InN, the width of the ribbons must be between 2 and 3 nm. If larger bang gap ribbons are needed (like Si, InP, or GaAs), their width must be reduced to 1-2 nm. According to the extrapolated inverse power law obtained in this work, armchair carbon nanoribbons of widths larger than 8 nm will present a maximum band gap of 0.3 eV, while for ribbons with a width of 80 nm the maximum possible band gap is 0.05 eV. For chiral nanoribbons the band gap oscillations rapidly vanish as a function of the chiral angle indicating that a careful design of their crystallographic nature is an essential ingredient for controlling their electronic properties. Optical excitations show important differences between ribbons with and without hydrogen termination and are found to be sensitive to the carbon nanoribbon width. This should provide a practical way of revealing information on their size and the nature of their edges.},

The TDDFT results show a strong dependence of the charge-transfer transition energies on the amount of the exact exchange in the functional. In general, TDDFT with range-separated functionals provides a good agreement with the experimental spectra. As a result a new assignment of the absorption spectrum of the title compound is proposed.},

@article{Boye-Peronne2014,
abstract = {The first quantitative description of the Rydberg and valence singlet electronic states of vinylidene lying in the 0-10 eV region is performed by using large scale ab initio calculations. A deep analysis of Rydberg-valence interactions has been achieved thanks to the comprehensive information contained in the accurate Multi-Reference Configuration Interaction wavefunctions and an original population analysis highlighting the respective role played by orbital and state mixing in such interactions. The present theoretical approach is thus adequate for dealing with larger than diatomic Rydberg systems. The nine lowest singlet valence states have been optimized. Among them, some are involved in strong Rydberg-valence interactions in the region of the Rydberg state equilibrium geometry. The Rydberg states of vinylidene present a great similarity with the acetylene isomer, concerning their quantum defects and Rydberg molecular orbital character. As in acetylene, strong s-d mixing is revealed in the n = 3 s-d supercomplex. Nevertheless, unlike in acetylene, the close-energy of the two vinylidene ionic cores (2)A1 and (2)B1 results into two overlapped Rydberg series. These Rydberg series exhibit local perturbations when an accidental degeneracy occurs between them and results in avoided crossings. In addition, some $\Delta$l = 1 (s-p and p-d) mixings arise for some Rydberg states and are rationalized in term of electrostatic interaction from the electric dipole moment of the ionic core. The strongest dipole moment of the (2)B1 cationic state also stabilizes the lowest members of the n = 3 Rydberg series converging to this excited state, as compared to the adjacent series converging toward the (2)A1 ionic ground state. The overall energies of vinylidene Rydberg states lie above their acetylene counterpart. Finally, predictions for optical transitions in singlet vinylidene are suggested for further experimental spectroscopic characterization of vinylidene.},

abstract  ="A new database (HAB7-) of electronic coupling matrix elements (Hab) for electron transfer in seven medium-sized negatively charged [small pi]-conjugated organic dimers is introduced. Reference data are obtained with spin-component scaled approximate coupled cluster method (SCS-CC2) and large basis sets. Assessed DFT-based approaches include constrained density functional theory (CDFT){,} fragment-orbital DFT (FODFT){,} self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (FODFTB) and the recently described analytic overlap method (AOM). This complements the previously reported HAB11 database where only cationic dimers were considered. The CDFT method in combination with a functional based on PBE and including 50% of exact exchange (HFX) was found to provide best estimates{,} with a mean relative unsigned error (MRUE) of 8.2%. CDFT couplings systematically increase with decreasing fraction of HFX as a consequence of increasing delocalisation of the SOMO orbital. The FODFT method is found to be very robust underestimating electronic couplings by 28%. The FODFTB and AOM methods{,} although orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of computational effort than the DFT approaches{,} perform well with reasonably small errors of 54% and 29%{,} respectively{,} translating in errors in the non-adiabatic electron transfer rate of a factor of 2.4 and 1.7{,} respectively. We discuss carefully various sources of errors and the scope and limitations of all assessed methods taking into account the results obtained for both HAB7- and HAB11 databases."}

Recent reports of impressive semiconductor properties of larger homologues have reinvigorated research in this field, leading to new methods for their synthesis, functionalization, and purification, as well as for fabricating organic electronic components. Studies performed on high-purity acene single crystals revealed their intrinsic electronic properties and provide useful benchmarks for thin film device research. New approaches to add functionality were developed to improve the processability of these materials in solution. These new functionalization strategies have recently allowed the synthesis of acenes larger than pentacene, which have hitherto been largely unavailable and poorly studied, as well as investigation of their associated structure/property relationships.},

The external power conversion efficiency of the devices under AM 1.5 solar illumination at 100 mW/cm 2 (1 sun) is 2.3plusmn0.5\% with relatively high open-circuit voltage (Voc=0.58plusmn0.06 V) compared to most of the other small-molecular donor-acceptor (D-A) heterojunction solar cells reported so far. Using atomic force microscopy and x-ray diffraction we found that tetracene thin films consist of submicron-sized grains with rough surface and well defined molecular order.

The present work provides an investigation of the optically allowed excited states of the acene series from pentacene to nonacene, the largest acene observed experimentally, using the density functional based multireference configuration method (DFT/MRCI). For this purpose, the ten lowest energy states of the B2u and B3u irreducible representations were computed. In agreement with previous computational investigations, the electronic wave functions of the acenes acquire significant multireference character with increasing acene size. The HOMO → LUMO excitation is the major contributor to the 1La state (p band, B2u) also for the larger acenes. The oscillator strength decreases with increasing length. The 1Lb state ($\alpha$ band, B3u), so far difficult to assign for the larger acenes due to overlap with photoprecursor bands, becomes almos...},

abstract = {A benchmark theoretical study of the electronic ground state and of the vertical and adiabatic singlet-triplet (ST) excitation energies of benzene (n=1) and n-acenes (C(4n+2)H(2n+4)) ranging from naphthalene (n=2) to heptacene (n=7) is presented, on the ground of single- and multireference calculations based on restricted or unrestricted zero-order wave functions. High-level and large scale treatments of electronic correlation in the ground state are found to be necessary for compensating giant but unphysical symmetry-breaking effects in unrestricted single-reference treatments. The composition of multiconfigurational wave functions, the topologies of natural orbitals in symmetry-unrestricted CASSCF calculations, the T1 diagnostics of coupled cluster theory, and further energy-based criteria demonstrate that all investigated systems exhibit a (1)A(g) singlet closed-shell electronic ground state. Singlet-triplet (S(0)-T(1)) energy gaps can therefore be very accurately determined by applying the principles of a focal point analysis onto the results of a series of single-point and symmetry-restricted calculations employing correlation consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets (X=D, T, Q, 5) and single-reference methods [HF, MP2, MP3, MP4SDQ, CCSD, CCSD(T)] of improving quality. According to our best estimates, which amount to a dual extrapolation of energy differences to the level of coupled cluster theory including single, double, and perturbative estimates of connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)] in the limit of an asymptotically complete basis set (cc-pVinfinityZ), the S(0)-T(1) vertical excitation energies of benzene (n=1) and n-acenes (n=2-7) amount to 100.79, 76.28, 56.97, 40.69, 31.51, 22.96, and 18.16 kcal/mol, respectively. Values of 87.02, 62.87, 46.22, 32.23, 24.19, 16.79, and 12.56 kcal/mol are correspondingly obtained at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVinfinityZ level for the S(0)-T(1) adiabatic excitation energies, upon including B3LYP/cc-PVTZ corrections for zero-point vibrational energies. In line with the absence of Peierls distortions, extrapolations of results indicate a vanishingly small S(0)-T(1) energy gap of 0 to approximately 4 kcal/mol (approximately 0.17 eV) in the limit of an infinitely large polyacene.},

abstract = {Recent work on solar cells based on interpenetrating polymer networks and solid-state dye-sensitized devices shows that efficient solar-energy conversion is possible using organic materials. Further, it has been demonstrated that the performance of photovoltaic devices based on small molecules can be effectively enhanced by doping the organic material with electron-accepting molecules. But as inorganic solar cells show much higher efficiencies, well above 15 per cent, the practical utility of organic-based cells will require their fabrication by lower-cost techniques, ideally on flexible substrates. Here we demonstrate efficiency enhancement by molecular doping in Schottky-type photovoltaic diodes based on pentacene--an organic semiconductor that has received much attention as a promising material for organic thin-film transistors, but relatively little attention for use in photovoltaic devices. The incorporation of the dopant improves the internal quantum efficiency by more than five orders of magnitude and yields an external energy conversion efficiency as high as 2.4 per cent for a standard solar spectrum. Thin-film devices based on doped pentacene therefore appear promising for the production of efficient 'plastic' solar cells.},

abstract = {One strategy to improve solar-cell efficiency is to generate two excited electrons from just one photon through singlet fission, which is the conversion of a singlet (S(1)) into two triplet (T(1)) excitons. For efficient singlet fission it is believed that the cumulative energy of the triplet states should be no more than that of S(1). However, molecular analogues that satisfy this energetic requirement do not show appreciable singlet fission, whereas crystalline tetracene displays endothermic singlet fission with near-unity quantum yield. Here we probe singlet fission in tetracene by directly following the intermediate multiexciton (ME) state. The ME state is isoenergetic with 2 × T(1), but fission is not activated thermally. Rather, an S(1) ⇔ ME superposition formed through a quantum-coherent process allows access to the higher-energy ME. We attribute entropic gain in crystalline tetracene as the driving force for the subsequent decay of S(1) ⇔ ME into 2 × T(1), which leads to a high singlet-fission yield.},

Focusing on the role of solvent-induced energy level fluctuations that would be present in a dye-sensitized solar cell, we present a microscopic model for singlet fission. Starting from an electronic model Hamiltonian, we construct diabatic states in a manifold of single and double excitations with total singlet multiplicity and then develop a multilevel non-Markovian theory of dynamics for electronic populations in the presence of energy level fluctuations. Depending on the energy scales, energy gap fluctuations can either facilitate or hinder interconversion steps that lead to singlet fission. We critically assess the Markovian approximation that leads to golden rule rates and study the role of intramolecular solvation dynamics and electron transfer.},

abstract = {Singlet fission is a spin-allowed process by which a singlet excited state is converted to two triplet states. To understand mechanisms of the ultrafast fission via a charge transfer (CT) state, one has investigated the dynamics through quantum-dynamical calculations with the uncorrelated fluctuation model; however, the electronic states are expected to experience the same fluctuations induced by the surrounding molecules because the electronic structure of the triplet pair state is similar to that of the singlet state except for the spin configuration. Therefore, the fluctuations in the electronic energies could be correlated, and the 1D reaction coordinate model may adequately describe the fission dynamics. In this work we develop a model for describing the fission dynamics to explain the experimentally observed behaviors. We also explore impacts of fluctuations in the energy of the CT state on the fission dynamics and the mixing with the CT state. The overall behavior of the dynamics is insensitive to values of the reorganization energy associated with the transition from the singlet state to the CT state, although the coherent oscillation is affected by the fluctuations. This result indicates that the mixing with the CT state is rather robust under the fluctuations in the energy of the CT state as well as the high-lying CT state.},

abstract = {The inclusion of dynamical and static electron correlation (SEC) is mandatory for accurate quantum chemistry (QC). SEC is particularly difficult to calculate and hence a qualitative understanding is important to judge the applicability of approximate QC methods. Existing scalar SEC diagnostics, however, lack the important information where the SEC effects occur in a molecule. We introduce an analysis tool based on a fractional occupation number weighted electron density ($\rho$(FOD) ) that is plotted in 3D for a pre-defined contour surface value. The scalar field is obtained by finite-temperature DFT calculations with pre-defined electronic temperature (e.g. TPSS at 5000 K). FOD plots only show the contribution of the "hot" (strongly correlated) electrons. We discuss illustrative plots for a broad range of chemical systems from small molecules to large conjugated molecules with polyradicaloid character. Spatial integration yields a single number which can be used to globally quantify SEC.},

Many fJ' bands are assigned for the first time, and estimates are given for the position of the a band in anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene. From the slopes and intercepts of the regressions, important conclusions regarding the wavefunctions of the excited states and the role of electron repulsion and CI can be drawn. In some hydrocarbons the energies of the four uv transitions are shown to correlate with IP] and IP 3 rather than with IP] and IP 2 • An analysis of this finding in terms of perimeter orbitals is given, and a novel classification of PE bands based on vibrational fine structure and correlation with perimeter states is presented.

(presented here) of polarizabilities and of potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. We emphasize the benefits of partial augmentation of the higher-zeta basis sets in preference to full augmentation at a lower \OE∂ level. Benefits and limitations of the use of fully, partially, and minimally augmented basis sets are reviewed for different electronic structure methods and mol. properties. We have found that minimal augmentation is almost always enough for d. functional theory (DFT) when applied to ionization potentials, electron affinities, atomization energies, barrier heights, and hydrogen-bond energies. For elec. dipole polarizabilities, we find that augmentation beyond minimal has an av. effect of 8\% at the polarized triple-\OE∂ level and 5\% at the polarized quadruple-\OE∂ level. The effects are larger for potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. The effects are also larger for wave function theory (WFT). Even for WFT though, full augmentation is not needed for most purposes, and a level of augmentation between minimal and full is optimal for most problems. The calendar basis sets named after the months provide a convergent sequence of partially augmented basis sets that can be used for such calcns. The jun-cc-pV(T + d)Z basis set is very useful for MP2-F12 calcns. of barrier heights and hydrogen bond strengths. [on SciFinder(R)]},

The states giving rise to the largest 2PA cross sections are analyzed in terms of their orbital character and symmetry-based selection rules. The brightest 2PA transitions correspond to Rydberg-like states from fully symmetric irreducible representations. Symmetry selection rules dictate that totally symmetric transitions typically have the largest 2PA cross sections for an orientationally averaged sample when there is no resonance enhancement via one-photon accessible intermediate states. Transition dipole arguments suggest that the strongest transitions also involve the most delocalized orbitals, including Rydberg states, for which the relative transition intensities can be rationalized in terms of atomic selection rules.

abstract = {In this report we introduce an iterative procedure for constructing a quasidiabatic Hamiltonian representing N(state)-coupled electronic states in the vicinity of an arbitrary point in N(int)-dimensional nuclear coordinate space. The Hamiltonian, which is designed to compute vibronic spectra employing the multimode vibronic coupling approximation, includes all linear terms which are determined exactly using analytic gradient techniques. In addition, all [N(state)][N(int)] quadratic terms, where [n]=n(n+1)/2, are determined from energy gradient and derivative coupling information obtained from reliable multireference configuration interaction wave functions. The use of energy gradient and derivative coupling information enables the large number of second order parameters to be determined employing ab initio data computed at a limited number of points (N(int) being minimal) and assures a maximal degree of quasidiabaticity. Numerical examples are given in which quasidiabatic Hamiltonians centered around three points on the C(3)H(3)N(2) potential energy surface (the minimum energy point on the ground state surface and the minimum energy points on the two- and three-state seams of conical intersection) were computed and compared. A method to modify the conical intersection based Hamiltonians to better describe the region of the ground state minimum is introduced, yielding improved agreement with ab initio results, particularly in the case of the Hamiltonian defined at the two-state minimum energy crossing.},

All vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule are considered in the potential energy surface calculations and the quantum dynamical treatment.

Furthermore, spin-orbit couplings are evaluated on a geometry-dependent grid, and diabatized along with the different conical intersections. Our results show for the first time the primordial role of the triplet (3)B2 state and furthermore predict novel interference patterns due to the different intersystem crossing channels induced by the spin-orbit couplings and the shapes of the different potential energy surfaces.

At such intersections the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, and unexpected dynamical processes result, which can be observed spectroscopically. We review the basic theory required to understand and describe conical, and related, intersections. A simple model is presented, which can be used to classify the different types of intersections known.

Phys. 57, 59 (1984)], an ansatz for quasidiabatic wave functions is introduced in the framework of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theory. Based on the ansatz, the theory for the analytic first derivative of the off-diagonal element of the quasidiabatic potential matrix is developed by extending the theory for the analytic gradient of the EOM-CC energy. This analytic derivative is implemented for EOM-CCSD (singles and doubles approximation) calculations of radicals subject to pseudo-Jahn-Teller and Jahn-Teller interactions. Its applicability in construction of the KDC quasidiabatic model potential is discussed.},

Semiempirical self-consistent-field molecular orbitals (SCF MO's) are computed with geometry-dependent occupation numbers, in order to ensure correct homolytic dissociation, fragment orbital degeneracy, and partial optimization of the lowest virtuals. Electronic wave functions are of the MO active space configuration interaction (CI) type, for which analytic energy gradients have been implemented. The time-dependent electronic wave function is propagated by means of a local diabatization algorithm which is inherently stable also in the case of surface crossings. The method is tested for the problem of excited ethylene nonadiabatic dynamics, and the results are compared with recent quantum mechanical calculations. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Mai2016,
abstract = {Elucidating the photophysical mechanisms in sulfur-substituted nucleobases (thiobases) is essential for designing prospective drugs for photo- and chemotherapeutic applications. Although it has long been established that the phototherapeutic activity of thiobases is intimately linked to efficient intersystem crossing into reactive triplet states, the molecular factors underlying this efficiency are poorly understood. Herein we combine femtosecond transient absorption experiments with quantum chemistry and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations to investigate 2-thiocytosine as a necessary step to unravel the electronic and structural elements that lead to ultrafast and near-unity triplet-state population in thiobases in general. We show that different parts of the potential energy surfaces are stabilized to different extents via thionation, quenching the intrinsic photostability of canonical DNA and RNA nucleobases. These findings satisfactorily explain why thiobases exhibit the fastest intersystem crossing lifetimes measured to date among bio-organic molecules and have near-unity triplet yields, whereas the triplet yields of canonical nucleobases are nearly zero.},

abstract = {The importance of triplet states in the photorelaxation dynamics of SO2 is studied by mixed quantum-classical dynamics simulations. Using the SHARC method, standing for Surface Hopping including ARbitrary Couplings, intersystem crossing (ISC) processes caused by spin-orbit coupling are found occurring on an ultrafast time scale (few 100 fs) and thus competing with internal conversion. While in the singlet-only dynamics only oscillatory population transfer between the (1)B1 and (1)A2 states is observed, in the dynamics including singlet and triplet states we find additionally continuous ISC to the (3)B2 state and to a smaller extent to the (3)B1/(3)A2 coupled states. The populations obtained from the dynamics are discussed with respect to the overall nuclear motion and in the light of recent TRPEPICO studies [I. Wilkinson, A. E. Boguslavskiy, J. Mikosch, D. M.

abstract = {New basis sets of the atomic natural orbital (ANO) type have been developed for the main group and rare gas atoms. The ANO's have been obtained from the average density matrix of the ground and lowest excited states of the atom, the positive and negative ions, and the dimer at its equilibrium geometry. Scalar relativistic effects are included through the use of a Douglas−Kroll Hamiltonian. Multiconfigurational wave functions have been used with dynamic correlation included using second-order perturbation theory (CASSCF/CASPT2). The basis sets are applied in calculations of ionization energies, electron affinities, and excitation energies for all atoms and the ground-state potentials for the dimers. These calculations include spin−orbit coupling using the RASSCF State Interaction (RASSI-SO) method. The spin−orbit splitting for the lowest atomic term is reproduced with an accuracy of better than 0.05 eV, except for row 5, where it is 0.15 eV. Ionization energies and electron affinities have an accuracy better than 0.2 eV, and atomic polarizabilities for the spherical atoms are computed with errors smaller than 2.5{\%}. Computed bond energies for the dimers are accurate to better than 0.15 eV in most cases (the dimers for row 5 excluded).},

abstract = {Forming upon absorption of a UV photon, excited states of DNA are subject to nonadiabatic evolution, via either internal conversion (IC) back to the ground state or mutagenesis. Nonadiabatic processes following the formation of the first singlet excited states, S1, in 10 different small DNA fragments--4 single 4'H-nucleosides, 2 Watson-Crick base pairs, and 4 nucleotide quartets--have been investigated. Simulations were done via the nonadiabatic direct trajectory surface hopping semiclassical dynamics. The electronic wave function was obtained with configuration interaction, based on the semiempirical AM1 and PM3 Hamiltonians with fractional orbital occupation numbers. The evolution of the electronic wave function was governed by the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation with a locally diabatic representation, intrinsically stable near surface crossings. The nuclei evolved on adiabatic potential energy surfaces, as prescribed by classical Newtonian dynamics, with sudden hops between potential energy surfaces to account for nonadiabatic transitions. The "fewest switches" surface hopping algorithm coupled the quantum and classical parts of the system. The dynamics simulations revealed several routes of nonadiabatic relaxation in these systems, which were not reported previously, and also recovered known routes of IC.},

There is a conical intersection coupling this state to the cationic ground state,(X) over tilde and this plays a major role in the system evolution. The direct dynamics study consists of 80 trajectories, with the potential energy surfaces calculated on-the-fly using a complete active space (CASSCF) electronic wave function. The quantum dynamics used a model Hamiltonian and the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method to solve the time evolution of the nuclear wave packet. The results show that the methods give a similar description of the initial part of the dynamics, with a similar time scale for the interstate crossing. A qualitatively different behavior is, however, seen after crossing to the lower adiabatic surface, with a recurrence in the quantum dynamics not present in the direct dynamics. The direct dynamics also indicates the possible importance of a second intersection seam, which is not present in the model used for the quantum dynamics.},

Fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) is found to be surprisingly accurate over a large swath of parameter space. The inclusion of decoherence corrections via the augmented FSSH algorithm improves the accuracy of dynamical behavior compared to exact simulations, but the effects are generally not dramatic, at least for the case of an environment modeled with the commonly used Debye spectral density.},

abstract = {Distinct photophysical behavior of nucleobase adenine and its constitutional isomer, 2-aminopurine, has been studied by using quantum chemical methods, in particular an accurate ab initio multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory. After light irradiation, the efficient, ultrafast energy dissipation observed for nonfluorescent 9H-adenine is explained here by the nonradiative internal conversion process taking place along a barrierless reaction path from the initially populated 1(pipi* La) excited state toward a low-lying conical intersection (CI) connected with the ground state. In contrast, the strong fluorescence recorded for 2-aminopurine at 4.0 eV with large decay lifetime is interpreted by the presence of a minimum in the 1(pipi* La) hypersurface lying below the lowest CI and the subsequent potential energy barrier required to reach the funnel to the ground state. Secondary deactivation channels were found in the two systems related to additional CIs involving the 1(pipi* Lb) and 1(npi*) states. Although in 9H-adenine a population switch between both states is proposed, in 7H-adenine this may be perturbed by a relatively larger barrier to access the 1(npi*) state, and, therefore, the 1(pipi* Lb) state becomes responsible for the weak fluorescence measured in aqueous adenine at approximately 4.5 eV. In contrast to previous models that explained fluorescence quenching in adenine, unlike in 2-aminopurine, on the basis of the vibronic coupling of the nearby 1(pipi*) and 1(npi*) states, the present results indicate that the 1(npi*) state does not contribute to the leading photophysical event and establish the prevalence of a model based on the CI concept in modern photochemistry.},

In this work, we proceed through a comprehensive investigation of on-the-fly surface-hopping simulations of 9H-adenine in the gas phase using different electronic structure theories (ab initio, semi-empirical, and density functional methods). Simulations that employ ab initio and semi-empirical multireference configuration interaction methods predict the experimentally observed ultrafast deactivation of 9H-adenine with similar time scales, however, through different internal conversion channels. Simulations based on time-dependent density functional theory with six different hybrid and range-corrected functionals fail to predict the ultrafast deactivation. The origin of these differences is analyzed by systematic calculations of the relevant reaction pathways, which show that these discrepancies can always be traced back to topographical features of the underlying potential energy surfaces.},

abstract = {2-Aminopurine (2 AP) is a fluorescent isomer of adenine and has a fluorescence lifetime of {\{}{\~{}}{\}}11 ns in water. It is widely used in biochemical settings as a site-specific fluorescent probe of DNA and RNA structure and base-flipping and -folding. These assays assume that 2 AP is intrinsically strongly fluorescent. Here, we show this not to be the case, observing that gas-phase, jet-cooled 2-aminopurine and 9-methyl-2-aminopurine have very short fluorescence lifetimes (156 ps and 210 ps, respectively); they are, to all intents and purposes, non-fluorescent. We find that the lifetime of 2-aminopurine increases dramatically when it is part of a hydrate cluster, 2 AP {\{}{\textperiodcentered}{\}} (H2O)n, where n = 1-3. Not only does it depend on the presence of water molecules, it also depends on the specific hydrogen-bonding site to which they attach and on the number of H2O molecules at that site. We selectively microhydrate 2-aminopurine at its sugar-edge, cis-amino or trans-amino sites and see that its fluorescence lifetime increases by 4, 50 and 95 times (to 14.5 ns), respectively.},

abstract = {We present resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI), IR-UV, and UV-UV double resonance spectra of jet-cooled 2-aminopurine (2AP) as well as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas phase spectra. 2AP is a fluorescing isomer of the nucleobase adenine. The results show that there is only one tautomer of 2AP which absorbs in the wavelength range 32,300-34,500 cm(-1). The comparison with the calculated IR spectra of 9H- and 7H-2AP points to 9H-2AP as the dominating tautomer in the gas phase but the spectra are too similar to allow an unambiguous assignment to the respective tautomer. Hence, we determined vertical and adiabatic excitation energies of both tautomers employing combined density functional theory and multi-reference configuration interaction techniques. For the 0-0 band of the first 1pipi* transition of 9H-2AP we obtain a theoretical value of 32,328 cm(-1), in excellent agreement with the band origin of our R2PI spectrum at 32,371 cm(-1). The first singlet pipi* transition of the less stable 7H-2AP tautomer is predicted to be red-shifted by about 1700 cm(-1) with respect to the corresponding transition in 9H-2AP. From the absence of experimental bands in the energy region between 30,300 and 32,350 cm(-1) we conclude that 7H-2AP is not present to an appreciable extent in the molecular beam. Our calculations yield nearly equal energies for the 1npi* and 1pipi* minima of isolated 2AP, similar to the situation in adenine. The hitherto existing argument that the energetic order of states is responsible for the different spectroscopic properties of these isomers therefore does not hold. Rather, vibronic levels close to the origin of the 1pipi* transition cannot access the conical intersection between the 1pipi* and S(0) states along a puckering coordinate of the six-membered ring, in contrast to the situation in electronically excited 9H-adenine. As a consequence, a rich vibrational structure can be observed in the R2PI spectrum of 2AP whereas the spectrum of 9H-adenine breaks off at low energies.},

  abstract = {Radiationless deactivation pathways of excited gas phase nucleobases
	were investigated using mass-selected femtosecond resolved pump-probe
	resonant ionization. By comparison between nucleobases and methylated
	species, in which tautomerism cannot occur, we can access intrinsic
	mechanisms at a time resolution never reported so far (80 fs). At
	this time resolution, and using appropriate substitution, real nuclear
	motion corresponding to active vibrational modes along deactivation
	coordinates can actually be probed. We provide evidence for the existence
	of a two-step decay mechanism, following a 267 nm excitation of the
	nucleobases. The time resolution achieved together with a careful
	zero time-delay calibration between lasers allow us to show that
	the first step does correspond to intrinsic dynamics rather than
	to a laser cross correlation. For adenine and 9-methyladenine a first
	decay component of about 100 fs has been measured. This first step
	is radically increased to 200 fs when the amino group hydrogen atoms
	of adenine are substituted by methyl groups. Our results could be
	rationalized according to the effect of the highly localized nature
	of the excitation combined to the presence of efficient deactivation
	pathway along both pyrimidine ring and amino group out-of-plane vibrational
	modes. These nuclear motions play a key role in the vibronic coupling
	between the initially excited $\pi\pi^*$ and the dark $n\pi^*$ states.
	This seems to be the common mechanism that opens up the earlier phase
	of the internal conversion pathway which then, in consideration of
	the rather fast relaxation times observed, would probably proceed
	via conical intersection between the $n\pi^*$ relay state and high
	vibrational levels of the ground state.},
